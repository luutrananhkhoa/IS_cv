        A school is very genuine place like a temple where we go daily to learn and study to go
        ahead in our life. We pray to God daily in the school for our better lives and proper study.
        We say good morning to our class teacher daily and she responses with her smiling face. Our
        school has a big garden back to the school building. School is the place where we learn
        everything with the help of our teachers. They help us in working hard for our study and
        make us tough to go ahead in our life. They tell us about cleanliness, hygiene and proper
        healthy diet.
